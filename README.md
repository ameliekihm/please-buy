## Description
Welcome to Please Buy! We are an e-commerce application specializing in the sale of electronic devices. Our application is designed to allow users to easily search through our inventory, filtering products by category (brand and color) to quickly find what they are looking for.

## Features

- Dynamic Product Display: Products are fetched from a JSON file and displayed dynamically. The list updates in real-time based on the user's selected filters.
- Category Filtering: Users can filter products by brand (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi) and color (Silver, Dark Blue, Black) to narrow down the selection.
- Responsive Design: The application layout is fully responsive, adapting to various web browser window sizes. Whether the window is large or small, the design remains consistent and user-friendly.
- Optimized Performance: The application efficiently handles the filtering and display of products, providing a smooth user experience.

## Technology Stack
### 1. HTML5
Provides the structure and layout for the application.

### 2. CSS3
Used for styling the application, with a focus on responsive design. CSS variables and media queries are employed to ensure consistent styling across different screen sizes.

### 3. JavaScript (ES6+)
Handles the dynamic fetching, filtering, and displaying of products. Event listeners are used to manage user interactions.

### 4. JSON
Product data is stored in a JSON file, which is fetched and processed by the JavaScript code to dynamically generate the product list.


## How It Works
### 1. Loading Products
When the application loads, it fetches the product data from a local JSON file.

### 2. Displaying Products
The products are displayed in a list, with each item showing the product's image, brand, device type, and capacity.

### 3. Filtering Products
Users can filter products by clicking on brand icons or color buttons. The product list updates in real-time to show only the items that match the selected criteria.

### 4. Resetting Filters
Clicking the Please Buy logo resets the filters, displaying the full list of products again.
